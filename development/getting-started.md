# Compile
- Make sure you can compile a basic C++ hello world example
- Make sure you can compile and run GlPortal using the instructions in COMPILE.md in the repository

# Find your first task
- Check the bug tracker on github for Radix and GlPortal or the Map-Editor and see if there are simple tasks that you think you can work on
- Refine an existing issue
- Split a sub-task off an issue or an epic
- Create a new issue to work on
- Create a refactoring issue and work on that

Please consider the following

- Your first issues should be of low complexity and solvable in a short period of time
- Due to differences in time zones communication might come with a delay so consider using gitter and slack as a means of communication
