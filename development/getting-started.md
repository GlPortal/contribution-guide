# Compile
Make sure you can compile and run GlPortal using the COMPILE.md in the repository.

# Find a first task
You can do either of these

- Check the bug tracker on github for Radix and GlPortal and see if there are simple tasks in there
- Refine an existing issue
- Split a sub-task off an issue or an epic
- Create a new issue to work on
- Create a refactoring issue and work on that

Please consider the following

- Your first issues should be of low complexity and solvable in short time
- Due to differences in time zones communication might come with a delay so consider using gitter as a means of communication
