# Workflow
## Issue
- Find or create a github issue you want to work on
- Split the issue up if needed. Anything bigger than 2 weeks is way too big
- It will be beneficial to refine the issue with the team before you pull it to *in progress*
## Work
- Create a new branch that has the issue id as the name
- Create new tests where it applies
- Create test maps where it applies
- Create your changes on the branch
- Rebase with master if needed (don't merge master into your branch)
## Test
- Check if all the tests pass
- Create a PR and ask any or all members of technical-officers-engine to review the PR
- Wait for your team mates to sign off on the PR
## Finish
- Merge your branch into master
- Delete your branch
# Don't
- Work on more than one github issue in one branch at once or do more than what the issue calls for.
- Merge master back into your branch. Use rebase.
- Work on Epics (anything above 2 weeks) but split them up into smaller tasks
